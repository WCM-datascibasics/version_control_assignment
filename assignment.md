## Chapter 3 Assignment

From this point onwards, you will be managing your assignments with `git` and submitting them through GitHub. The aim of this assignment is to get you familiarized with a common version control workflow.

#### Getting Started
Make sure you've <em>forked</em> this repository under your own GitHub account, and then clone your own repository to your computer. You will push the changes you've made to this document as submission to GitHub.

If the version control concepts or `git` commands are still confusing to you, consider re-reading and following the online notes, or check out an interactive tutorial like [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/).

#### The Assignment:
 0. Create a branch in this assignment repository named `submission`, then list all the branches you have (Hint: look at the Branch chapter of notes on how branches work, how to create new ones, and check existing branches):

    ```bash
    # git checkout -b submission
      main
      submission
    ```

 1. List the current `remote` name and hyperlink destination of this assignment repository (Hint: if you are not sure, add `--help` after your command to check remotes.). 

    ```bash
    # git remote: origin
      git remote get-url: https://github.com/Moonioze/version_control_assignment.git
    ```


 2. Add a second remote destination named `upstream` to your assignment repository, `upstream` is a common name used for the repository that people have forked from, in our case, the `upstream` will be at `https://github.com/WCM-datascibasics/version_control_assignment`. List the new list of remotes after you've added the new remote. 
 
    ```bash
    # origin
      upstream
    ```

 3. Save your modifications to this file so far and create a commit indicating you've answered the first 2 questions. Then try pushing the changes to the `upstream` destination on GitHub. What happens? Explain in your own words why does this happen? What are the benefits of having this `upstream` remote added when working collaboratively (Hint: read git command outputs!)?

    > I was denied access to the upstream remote. I believe this happens because I am not the owner of that github server. This is great for collaborative work because it prevents changes from being pushed into a backup repository, or the original repository. Having this as a backup or keeping it safe from open source modifications that may not be ideal can keep a project healthy. The owner of the server would need to verify or review changes through a pull request and then implement them if they are good.


 4. Now clone the repository for the [class website](https://github.com/WCM-datascibasics/wcm-datascibasics.github.io), and in the class website repository:
    - a. Explore the version history by visualizing it as a graph (remember the dog meme?).
        ```bash
        # git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph

        ```

    - b. Who was the last person to modify `README.md`? (Hint: use `git log` with an argument)
        ```bash
        # git log --author-date-order README.md
commit 00e8ae51a08a0f3754ab228f62b51651595c4426
Author: Xihe Xie <axiezai@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Dec 28 16:01:51 2020 -0500

    readme and try new size
        ```
    
    - c. What was the commit message associated with the last modification to the `-Week 2` line of `index.md` file? (Hint: use `git blame` and `git show`, check out their help pages if you are not sure what to do)
	commit message: added ch2 assignment

 5. In the course website repository (or another repository you want to clone from GitHub), modify one of its existing files, do not `git add` or `git commit` yet:
     - a. What happens when you do `git stash`, be specific about what happens to your uncommitted changes after `stash`.?
       > After performing git stash, the modifications that I made were stashed away in a dirty working directory and changes were reverted back to the previous commit.
     - b. What do you see when you run `git log --all --oneline` after stashing your modification?
       > 28faa50 (refs/stash) WIP on master: 208edcf last lecture
         4736a8e index on master: 208edcf last lecture
         Are these technically new commits?
     - c. Look up what `git stash drop` and `git stash pop` does, either Google or use `--help`. Run `git stash drop` to undo what you did with `stash`, in what scenario might `stash`-ing, `pop`-ing, and `drop`-ing be useful?
       > stashing may be useful when you make certain modifications to files that may or may not be implemented into your work. You can stash those edits for later and return to the previous state before your modifications were made. popping may be useful when you decide that those previously stashed edits or modifications are useful for your work and you want to commit them. dropping would be useful when you decide the opposite, you decide those stashed changes are not what you wanted. Pretty neat stuff!

 6. One common mistake when learning `git` is to commit large files that should not be managed by `git` or adding sensitive information like security keypairs for Amazon Cloud Services. Navigate back to your assignment repository and try adding a random text file to the repository (use `touch`), making some modifications and commits to your repository, and deleting that file with `rm`. But deleting with `rm` will not delete that file's recorded git history, therefore we need to do a little more. You may want to look at [this](https://help.github.com/articles/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository/))

    > Perform the commits and deletion, this question will be graded based on your commit history on GitHub. I should see commits for when you added your file and made modifications, and I should see a commit for when you deleted the files. 


 7. Like many command line tools, `git` provides a configuration file (or dotfile) called `~/.gitconfig`. Create an alias in `~/.gitconfig` so that when you run `git graph`, you get the output of `git log --all --graph --decorate --oneline`. You can do this by directly modifying the `~/.gitconfig` file or by using the `git` command line functionality.
    ```bash
    # git config --global alias.graph 'log --all --graph --decorate --oneline'
    ```
    This is also a good opportunity to turn your dotfiles folder into a version controlled repo (Use `git init` in your dotfiles folder), make it private if you have sensitive `ssh` configurations there (IP Addresses), else feel free to make it public. (This is for your own benefit, not part of the assignment grading)

 8. You can define global ignore patterns in `~/.gitignore_global` after running `git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global`. Do this, and set up your global `gitignore` file to ignore OS-specific or editor-specific temporary files, like `.DS_Store`, or `.vscode`. Feel free to Google around for common gitignore entries for Python projects or other projects of your interest.

    ```bash
    # # Compiled source #
###################
*.com
*.class
*.dll
*.exe
*.o
*.so

# Packages #
############
# it's better to unpack these files and commit the raw source
# git has its own built in compression methods
*.7z
*.dmg
*.gz
*.iso
*.jar
*.rar
*.tar
*.zip

# Logs and databases #

*.sql
*.sqlite

# OS generated files #
######################
.DS_Store
.DS_Store?
._*
.Spotlight-V100
.Trashes
ehthumbs.db
    ```

 9. Push the `submission` branch of your repository to your GitHub remote. Your remote `main`/`master` branch should be unchanged since your fork. Now go to your GitHub repository settings and add `axiezai` as a collaborator. Now create a pull request to merge the changes from `submission` to `main`/`master`, assign your TA `axiezai` as a reviewer. You will receive feedback and grades through the pull request review.
